#Example of String manipulation and Code Intelligence.
'''
print("Hello World!\nHello world!\nHello world!")
      
print("Hello" + " " + "Angela")


#10.[Interactive Coding Exercise] Debugging.
#Day-string manipulation , String concatenation is done with the "+" sign.

#New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

#11.The python INPUT Function.

input("What is your name?")

input("A prompt for the users")

print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))

#input() will get user input in console.
#Then print() will print the word "Hello" and the user input.


#12.[Interactive Coding Exercise] Input Function.
#Input in Auditorium.

num1=int(input("Enter first number:"))
num2=int(input("Enter second number"))
num3=num1*num2
print(num3)

#Len() calculate length of the characters.

numofletters=len("Angela")
print(numofletters)

print(len(input("Enter characters:"))) #Bertrand(8char)

#13.Python variables.

name=input("what is your name?")

print(name)

name="jack"
print(name)

name="Angela"
print(name)

#Example.
name=input("what is your name?")

length=len(name)
print(length)

#14. [Interactive Coding Exercise] Variables.

a=input("Enter value:")#Assembly
b=input("Enter value:") #Basic

c=a
a=b
b=c

print("a: " + a) #Basic
print("b: " +b) #Assembly

#16. Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator

#1.create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band name generator.")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city=input("Which city did you grow up in?")
print(city)
#3.Ask the user for the name of a pet?
pet=input("what is the name of a pet?")
print(pet)
#4.Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " +pet)
#5. make sure the input cursor shows on a new line,see the example at:
